# Quizzical Trivia
This 'Meme Generator' is the Final Project that I did when I learn React from React Course (Scrimba) by Bob Ziroll (Head of Education at Scrimba). This Final Project is like a Final Test to pass the course because it's unguided, I make it from scratch, and Bob only tells me how is the UI and how it should be worked.

## What I learned in this project
- Make some components and state that can be sync/pass to each other
- Many challenging conditionals syntax should be done to make this works as supposed to be
- The raw data from API must be processed (this is tricky enough) correctly to apply it in this project
